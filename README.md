# Code Refactor Starter Code
Module-1
HORISEON code Refractor. Module-1 MSU Bootcamp

Hi, I am Jonathan Cerruti and this is my firt project in the MSU coding Bootcamp. The main objective of this assignment was to refractor an existing code. In this assignment I was "hired" by Marketing agency, HORISEON, to make their website more accessible. 

Technology
    HTML
    CSS

HTML changes made
    The Project started out with all <div> tags, so with the help of W3 schools HTML Semantic elements I determined what each <div> tag would be better tagged as, and what logical order these should be utilized. I ended up using <header>, <nav>, <figure>, <main>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer> tags.
    
    After sectioning off my HTML I discovered that all images on the html did not have alt attributes. I added these to help with visual impaired users and search engine discovery. 

    One bug fix that was essential to complete the HTML portion of the project was to fix the clickable links in the header. The links were intended to jump to the corresponding part of the page that described the link. 

CSS changes made
    My first change I made on the stylesheet was to create vriables for my repecting colors and fonts. I created 5 color variables, and 2 font variables. These variables are located at the top of the stylesheet under the root element are were named --white-1, --white-2 --blue, --dark-blue, --light-blue, --font-1, --font-2. I did this because it looks cleaner and will make it easier for future design updates.

    I then deleted and consolidated repeating styles.
